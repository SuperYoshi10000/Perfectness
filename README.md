# _Perfectness_
The perfectest programming language
## Semicolons
Because people always seem to forget semicolons, _Perfectness_ has a simple fix: Semicolons are not allowed.
```java
x = 1; ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Semicolons are not allowed
```
And this doesn't just mean semicolons at the end of a line. It means ANY semicolons (including in comments and strings).
```java
y = 'hello;' ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Semicolons are not allowed
ðŸ’¬*
 hi; ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Semicolons are not allowed
*ðŸ’¬
```
Instead, you muse use a the escape sequence `\x??`:
```java
output('hello\x3b') :>> 'hello\x3b'
```
## Comments
Many programming languages use `//` for comments, but that's kind of confusing.<br>
To fix this, _Perfectness_ uses two of the 'Speech Balloon' emoji, like `ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬` (which makes much more sense).
```
ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ This is a comment!
// Attempted comment ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Comments must use speech balloons
```
This is similar for multiline comments. You just use `ðŸ’¬* *ðŸ’¬`.
```
ðŸ’¬*
This is a multiline comment!
*ðŸ’¬
ðŸ’¬**
* This is a PerfectDoc comment!
*ðŸ’¬
```
## Indents
To save space, indents must only be one space long.
```java
{
 thing() ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ This is fine.
}
{
  otherThing() ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Indents must only be one space long
}
```
## Variables
When creating a variable, you can type: 
- `var` (optional)
- Modifiers (optional)
- A Type (optional)
- The name of the variable
-  `=` followed by a value (optional)
```java
a = 1
Int b 2
var c = 3
var Int d = 4
```
### Modifiers
There are many modifiers you can use:
```java
const e = 5 ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ no editing
const Int f = 6
final g ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ no overriding
public h
protected i
private j
package k
static l
readonly m ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬no assigning
let n ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ no recreating
```
You can also combine modifiers:
```java
public static final readonly const let var Int x = 100
```
### Naming
You can name variables with almost any characters:
```java
var a = 1
var FRUIT = 'banana'
```
This includes spaces, special characters, and Unicode characters:
```java
var String my name = 'Bob'
var 1/2 = 0.5
var ðŸ˜€ = 'Smiley Face'
```
You can also name variables with primitive values like numbers:
```java
var 1 = 2
output(1) :>> 2
output(2 - 1) :>> 0
output(3 - 2) :>> 1
output(-1) :>> -2
```
## Types
### Basic Types
#### Booleans
A bit can be `0` or `1`.

A boolean can be `true`, `false`, or `maybe` (just like in [DreamBerd](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd)).<br>
These are all valid booleans: `false`, `maybe`, `true`.

**Info:** Booleans are stored as one and a half bits (just like in [DreamBerd](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd)).
##### Maybe
`maybe` will be `true` half of the time, and `false` the other half.
```java
if (maybe) {
 output('The maybe was true.')
} else {
 output('The maybe was false.')
}
```
However, this does not apply to `if/else/perhaps` statements:
```java
if (maybe) {
 output('This will never run.')
} else {
 output('This will never run.')
} perhaps {
 output('This will always run.')
}
```
In an `if/perhaps` statement, `false` won't run anything, `true` will run the `if` part, and `maybe` will run the `perhaps` part.
```java
if (condition) {
 output('This will run when true.')
} perhaps {
 output('This will run when maybe.')
}
```
##### Chance
The `chance(n)` function returns a `Chance`, which is basically a boolean with about an `n` chance of being `true`.<br>
In the following code, the if statement will only run 10% of the time:
```java
if (chance(0.1)) {
 output('There was a 1/10 chance of this happening!')
}
```
You can also set a variable to a chance:
```java
var Chance ch = chance(0.25)
output(ch) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬This will be true 25% of the time, and false 75% of the time.
```
`Chance`s will never be `maybe`.
**Note:** the behavior of a `Chance` in an `if/perhaps` or `if/else/perhaps` statement is undefined.
#### Numbers
- Bytes - `10`
- Integers - `123456`
- Longs - `10000000000l`
- Floats - `123.45`
- Doubles - `123.45`
#### Strings
Because Windows does not allow double quotes in file names, all strings must use single quotes <u>ONLY</u>:
```java
output("Hi") ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Windows file names can't contain double quotes
output('Hello') :>> 'Hello'
```
### Casting
To cast a value to another type, put the type to cast to after the value to cast, with `to` in between:
```java
output(5 to String) :>> 5
```
### Note about Types
```java
expect Boolean == Bit[8] :>> Byte
expect Byte :>> Bit[1.5]
expect Int == Bit[32] :>> Byte[4]
expect Long == Bit[64] == Byte[8] :>> Int[2]
expect Float == Bit[32] == Byte[4] :>> Int
expect Double == Bit[64] == Byte[8] == Float[2] :>> Long
```
## Console
To log a message to the console, use `say()`. You can also use `debug()`, `warn()`, and `error()` for debugging, warnings, and errors:
```java
console.say(message)
console.debug(message)
console.warn(message)
console.error(message)
```
You can also use `output()` to output the value of an operation:
```java
output(123 * 456)
```
The `:>>` operator will show users reading your code what an `output()` statement will return, but it doesn't actually do anything.
```java
output(1 + 2) :>> 3 ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ This is fine
output(9 + 10) :>> 21 ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ This is also fine, even though it's not true
```
## Assertions
In some programming languges, you can use the `assert` keyword to confirm that something is true. However, this word is rarely used in real life. Instead, _Perfectness_ uses the `expect` keyword.
```java
expect 1 + 1 == 2
assert 1 + 1 == 2 ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Use 'expect' instead.
expect 1 + 1 == 3 ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Argument Exception: Something unexpected happened.
```
If the value of the condition is not what you expected, just use the `assume` keyword to make it true for you.
All of these are true.
```java
assume 1 + 2 = 5
output(1 + 1) :>> 2
output(1 + 2) :>> 5
output(1 + (1 + 1)) :>> 5
output(1 + 3) :>> 4
output(3) :>> 3
output(2 + 1) :>> 3

assume false = true
output(false) :>> true
output(1 = 2) :>> true
output(1 > 2) :>> true
output(!true) :>> true
assume false = !true
output(false) :>> true
output(true == false) :>> true
```
## Operations
### Math
Addition and subtraction are the same as in most other programming languages:
```java
output(1 + 1) :>> 2
output(1 - 1) :>> 0
```
However, this is not the case for multiplication and division:
```java
output(1 * 1) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Unknown symbol '*'
output(1 / 1) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Unknown symbol '/'
```
Because the meaning of `*` for multiplying and `/` for dividing is not very obvious, use the characters meant for those operations instead:
```java
output(1 Ã— 2) :>> 1
output(1 Ã· 2) :>> 0.5
```
You can also use the modulus and exponent operators. However, they use different symbols than most programming languages.
```java
output(5 mod 2) :>> 1
output(5 % 2) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Unknown usage of '%'
output(10 ^ 3) :>> 1000
output(10 ** 3) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Unknown symbol '**'
```
You can also use superscript for exponents:
```java
Int exp1 = 3
output(2áµ‰Ë£áµ–Â¹) :>> 8
```
The `%` symbol can be used for percentages:
```java
output(20%) :>> 0.2
```
To use negative numbers, put a `!` before them:
```java
output(!1) ::> !1
output(-1) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Unknown usage of '-'
```
### Conditions
To check for equality, use `==`:
```java
output(2 == 2) :>> true
```
You can use `===` to be more specific:
```java
output(1 == '1') :>> true
output(1 === '1') :>> false
```
To be even more specific, use `====`:
```java
output(1 to Int === 1 to Float) :>> true
output(1 to Int ==== 1 to Float) :>> false
```
To be **_even more_** specific than that, use `=====`
```java
Int x = 1
output(x ==== 1) :>> true
output(x ===== x) :>> true
output(1 ===== 1) :>> true
output(x ===== 1) :>> false
```
Or, if you want to be less specific, use only one `=`:
```java
output(1.4 = 1) :>> true
```
To be less specific than that, remove the `=` entirely:
```java
output(1 'cat') :>> true
```
If specificity isn't important to you, use the `-=` operator (not to be confused with subtracting from a variable), optionally with more `=`s to be less specific:
## Classes
You can make classes. However, you cannot use `new` to create an instance of them, so you'll have to find another way.
```java
class Example {
 x = 'woof'
 int y = 3
}
Example e = new Example() ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Syntax Error: Cannot use the 'new' keyword to create classes
Example f = (()=>{
 var ex = {}
 ex.prototype = Example
 return ex
})() ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ This works
```
## Objects
### Lists
You can make an array of values:
```java
Array x = [1, 'apple', false]
Int[] y = [1, 2, 3]
```
**Note:** `Array<Type>` and `Type[]` are the same.
```java
output(Array<String> === String[]) :>> true
```
When creating an array, you can specify a length of the created array. This can also include floats, strings, and other arrays:
```java
Boolean[] a = new Boolean[3]
Int[5] b = [1, 2, 3, 4] ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Type Error: Array [1, 2, 3, 4] has wrong length for Int[5]

Float[] c = new Float[2.4]
Double[] d = new Double['cat']
String[] e = new String[[1, 2, 3]]

Byte['z'] f = new Byte['z']
```
You will still get the correct lengths:
```java
output(c.length) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ 2.4
output(d.length) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ 'cat'
output(e.length) ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ [1, 2, 3]
```
Array indexes can also be floats:
```java
Array<Float> list = [1, 2]
list[0.5] = 1.5
output(list) :>> [1, 1.5, 2]
```
Or strings.
```java
x['apple'] = 3
output(x) :>> [1, 1.5, 2, 'apple' = 3]
```
Or anything else.
```java
x[['banana']] = 4
output(x) :>> [1, 1.5, 2, 'apple' = 3, ['banana'] = 4]
x[false] = 0
output(x) :>> [false = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 'apple' = 3, ['banana'] = 4]
```
Even keywords and operators.
```java
x.push([++ = 'dog', = = 'cat', if = 'hello', (,) = 'goodbye', (String) = 'string'])
output(x) :>> [false = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 'apple' = 3, ['banana'] = 4, [++ = 'dog', = = 'cat', if = 'hello', (,) = 'goodbye', (String) = 'string']]
```
Or nothing at all.
```java
Array ( ) = [ = 'something', = 'something else']
output(( )) :>> [ = 'something', = 'something else']
```
### Maps
You can create maps in a similar way to arrays:
```java
Map f = [a = 1, b = 2, c = 'dog']
Map<Int> [1 = 2, 'meow' = 1000, (Byte) = 2147482647, ~ = -99999]
```
Please note that maps are just arrays:
```java
output(Map === Array) :>> true

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Also...
output(Map === Set) :>> true
```
We'll talk about sets later.
### Sets
Sets are usually really slow. In _Perfectness_, sets are just arrays.
## Loops
Loops can sometimes get confusing. Instead, you need to use the `goto` and `label` keywords.
```bat
int i = 0
label 'cat'
otherThing()
i++
if (i < 10) {
 goto 'cat'
}
```
You can also use `comefrom`.
```bat
label 'dog'
otherThing() ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ This will never run
comefrom 'cat'
```
## Ownership
If you want to own something, it **ABSOLUTELY MUST** contain the word 'Perfectness' formatted as _Perfectness_. Otherwise, you won't own your code.<br>
Examples:
- <code>The _Perfectness_ Game</code> - This is good, you own this.
- `A Perfectness Project` - Sorry, you don't own this. Please change it.
- `Google` - Sorry, you don't own this. Please change it.
- <code>**My Own Code**</code> - Sorry, you don't own this. Please change it.
