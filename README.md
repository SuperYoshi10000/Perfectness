# _Perfectness_
The perfectest programming language

## Comments
Many programming languages use `//` for comments, but that's kind of confusing.<br>
To fix this, _Perfectness_ uses two of the "Speech Balloon" emoji, like `ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬` (which makes much more sense).
```
ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬ This is a comment!
```
This is similar for multiline comments. You just use `ğŸ’¬* *ğŸ’¬`.
```
ğŸ’¬*
This is a multiline comment!
*ğŸ’¬
ğŸ’¬**
* This is a PerfectDoc comment!
*ğŸ’¬
```

## Variables
When creating a variable, you can type: 
- `var` (optional)
- Modifiers (optional)
- A Type (optional)
- The name of the variable
- `=` followed by a value (optional)
```
a = 1
Int b 2
var c = 3
var Int d = 4
```
### Modifiers
There are many modifiers you can use:
```
const e = 5 ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬no editing
const Int f = 6
final g ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬
public h
protected i
private j
package k
static l
readonly m ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬no assigning
let n ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬no recreating
```
You can also combine modifiers:
```
public static final readonly const var Int x = 100
```
### Naming
You can name variables with almost any characters:
```
var a = 1
var FRUIT = ''banana''
```
This includes spaces, special characters, and Unicode characters:
```java
var String my name = ''Bob''
var 1/2 = 0.5
var ğŸ˜€ = ''Smiley Face''
```
You can also name variables to primitive values like numbers:
```java
var 1 = 2
output(1) = 2
output(2 - 1) = 0
output(3 - 2) = 1
output(-1) = -2
```
## Types
### Basic Types
#### Booleans
A bit can be `0` or `1`.

A boolean can be `true`, `false`, `maybe`, or something in between.<br>
These are all valid booleans: `false`, `true`, `maybe`, `chance(0.42)`
##### Maybe
`maybe` will be `true` half of the time, and `false` the other half.
```java
if (maybe) {
 output(''The maybe was true.'')
} else {
 output(''The maybe was false.'')
}
```
However, this 
#### Numbers
- Integers: `123`
123 Int
123.45 Float
'M' Char
"Hi" ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬ Syntax Error: " is invalid
''Hello'' String
### Casting
To cast a

### Note about Types
correct Int = [Bit sign, Bit[31] bits]
correct Float = [Int base, Int exponent]

## Console
console.say(message)
console.warn(message)
console.error(message)

output(123 * 456)

## Assertions
expect 1 + 1 = 2

All of these are true

assume 1 + 2 = 5
output(1 + 1) = 2
output(1 + 2) = 5
output(1 + (1 + 1)) = 5
output(1 + 3) = 4
output(3) = 3
output(2 + 1) = 3

assume false
output(false) = true
output(1 = 2) = true
output(1 > 2) = true
output(!true) = true
assume false = !true
output(false) = true
output(true = false) = true

## Math
output(1 + 1) = 2
output(1 - 1) = 0
These dont't work
output(1 * 1) ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬ Error
output(1 / 1) ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬ Error
Use these instead
output(1 Ã— 2) = 1
output(1 Ã· 2) = 0.5

ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬addition
output(1 + 1)

ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬subtraction
ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬multiplication
ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬division

ğŸ’¬ğŸ’¬division
